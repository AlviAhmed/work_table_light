# Work Table Light 

The goal is to learn more about ADC as well create a custom and unique work table light since I need a light that can cover my whole work table as well as have other functions that I need.

A table light must obviously be bright, therefore planning to use a white led strip for the main lighting which can be dimmed using a dimmer switch.

Not only that but in the schematic I included 3 switches due to the fact that many times I don't need my whole table to be lit up, sometimes only portions. Therefore I give myself the choice to light up whole table or just a portion(s) of my table.

For an added bonus, I am also planning to add an RGB led strip. This is not only for fun (party mode) or aesthetic lighting (color scrolling potentiometer), but for utility.

Since red light is better for your eyes, especially at night , I thought it would be great to have a type of night mode where the RGB light goes red and the white led turns off. Thus great for working late night. 

Schematic still a work in progress
