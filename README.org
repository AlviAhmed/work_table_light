* Overview

The goal of this project was to learn more about ADC as well create a custom and unique work table light since I need a light that can cover my whole work table as well as have other functions that I need.

A table light must obviously be bright, therefore  white led strips for the main lighting which can be dimmed using a dimmer switch.

Not only that but in the schematic, I included 3 switches due to the
fact that I often don't need my whole table to be lit up, sometimes only portions. Therefore I give myself the choice to light up whole table or just a portion(s) of my table.

For an added bonus, I am also planning to add an RGB led strip. This is not only for aesthetic lighting (color scrolling potentiometer), but for utility.
Since green light is better for your eyes in dark environements. I
thought it would be great to have a type of night mode where the RGB
light goes green and the white led turns off. Thus great for working
late night.
